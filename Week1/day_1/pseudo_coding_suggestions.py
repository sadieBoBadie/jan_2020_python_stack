# 1.) Copy the prompt and put in in your code.

# Flexible Counter - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. 
# Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers 
# that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, 
# and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)

# 2.) Psuedocode - Plain language (brain storm)
#    Set 3 vars
#    Make a for loop i (start at lownum, highNum +1, ????)
#    What to do each time through??
#    need a print statement -- maybe an if statement -- if multiple
# --- how to test if multiples  --> i % mult == 0

#  3.) Test 
#  4.) t-diagram, go step by step
#  5.) print statements --> assert/test your assumptions.
